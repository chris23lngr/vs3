# vs3

`vs3` is a TypeScript-first library for secure S3 storage access. It generates presigned upload URLs, enforces validation and integrates cleanly with modern runtimes. We use the official AWS S3 SDK (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`) under the hood to interact with your storage provider.

Read the [documentation](https://vs3.dev) for more information.
