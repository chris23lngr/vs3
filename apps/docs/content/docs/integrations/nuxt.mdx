description: Mount the vs3 request handler in Nuxt 3 with Nitro and H3.
---

`vs3` does not need a dedicated Nuxt adapter.
Nuxt 3 (Nitro) can mount the Web handler directly with `h3`'s `fromWebHandler`.

## Basic Setup

```ts title="server/api/storage/[...all].ts"
import { fromWebHandler } from "h3";
import { storage } from "../../storage";

export default fromWebHandler(storage.handler);
```

This mounts the `vs3` API at `/api/storage/**`.

## Why This Works

`storage.handler` is a standard Web `Request -> Response` handler. `fromWebHandler` bridges that handler into Nitro's event system.

## Client Usage

Nuxt apps can use the Vue client from `vs3/vue` and keep types synced with `typeof storage.$Infer`.

```ts title="lib/storage-client.ts"
import { createStorageClient } from "vs3/vue";
import type { storage } from "~/server/storage";

export const storageClient = createStorageClient<typeof storage.$Infer>({});
```

<Callout type="warn">
    Use a type-only import for `storage` so server code is not bundled into client output.
</Callout>
