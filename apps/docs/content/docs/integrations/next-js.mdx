description: Integrate vS3 with Next.js
---

We provide a built-in integration for Next.js. This integration allows you to use vS3 with Next.js out of the box.

## Usage

To use the built-in integration for Next.js, use the `toNextJsRouteHandler` function to convert the storage handler to a Next.js route handler.

```ts title="app/api/storage/[...all]/route.ts"
import { toNextJsRouteHandler } from "vs3/integrations/next-js";
import { storage } from "../storage";

export const { GET, POST, PUT, DELETE } = toNextJsRouteHandler({ handler: storage.handler });
```

This will automatically handle all the HTTP methods for you.
