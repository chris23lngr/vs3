description: Mount the vs3 request handler in Next.js App Router route handlers.
---

`vs3` provides `toNextJsRouteHandler` to map your `storage.handler` to Next.js route exports.
Use it in an App Router route and mount it at the same path your client calls (default: `/api/storage`).

## Basic Setup

```ts title="app/api/storage/[...all]/route.ts"
import { toNextJsRouteHandler } from "vs3/integrations/next-js";
import { storage } from "@/server/storage";

export const { GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS } =
  toNextJsRouteHandler({ handler: storage.handler });
```

## Why This Works

`storage.handler` is a standard Web handler: `(req: Request) => Promise<Response>`.

Next.js route handlers use the same Request/Response model, so the integration is a direct mapping.


## Next Steps

- [createStorage](/docs/server/create-storage) for server setup.
- [Endpoints](/docs/server/endpoints) for request/response contracts.
- [Nuxt integration](/docs/integrations/nuxt) if you also run Nitro routes.
