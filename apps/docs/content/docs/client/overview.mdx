title: Client Overview
description: Understand how vs3 client SDKs communicate with the server and manage upload/download state.
---

`vs3` ships framework-specific client SDKs (`vs3/react`, `vs3/vue`) that wrap a shared base client. Every SDK follows the same architecture:

1. **Create a client** with `createStorageClient` — configure the server URL, validation rules, and type contract.
2. **Use hooks/composables** (`useUpload`, `useDownload`, `useMultipartUpload`) to trigger operations and track reactive state.

## Request Flow

All client operations communicate with the server endpoints exposed by `storage.handler`:

```text
Client SDK
  -> validates file locally (size, type, name)
  -> calls server endpoint (e.g. /upload-url)
  -> receives presigned URL
  -> uploads/downloads directly to/from S3
```

The client never sends file bytes through your server. Files flow directly between the browser and S3 using presigned URLs.

## Shared State Model

Every hook/composable returns a reactive `state` object with a consistent shape:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | `"idle" \| "loading" \| "success" \| "error"` | Current operation status |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | `true` while the operation is in progress |
| `data` | `Result \| null` | Operation result on success |
| `error` | `StorageError \| null` | Error details on failure |
| `progress` | `number` | Upload progress from `0` to `1` (upload hooks only) |

State transitions follow a predictable cycle: `idle` → `loading` → `success` or `error`.

## Client-Side Validation

Before making any network request, the client validates:

- **File size** against `maxFileSize` (if configured).
- **File name** for path traversal and invalid characters.
- **File type** against `allowedFileTypes` using MIME type, extension, and magic byte detection (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, PDF).

<Callout type="info">
  Client-side validation is an early-exit optimization. The server always enforces its own rules regardless of what the client checks.
</Callout>

## Framework Differences

The API surface is identical across frameworks. The only difference is how reactive state is exposed:

- **React**: hooks use `useState` — `state` is a plain object that triggers re-renders.
- **Vue**: composables use `ref` — `state` is a `Readonly<Ref<T>>`.

All options, callbacks, methods, and result types are shared.

- [Create a Storage Client](/docs/client/create-storage-client) for setup and type inference.
- [useUpload](/docs/client/use-upload) for single-file uploads.
- [useDownload](/docs/client/use-download) for presigned download URLs.
- [useMultipartUpload](/docs/client/use-multipart-upload) for large file uploads.
